<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to <b>jankyscroll 2.0</b></h2>

<p>Jankyscroll makes your website's UX undeniably worse. Let's talk about a couple ways you could delude yourself into thinking that you want this.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>First and foremost, <b>jankyscroll</b> is a tool for randomized, organic content discovery. Users can unintentionally (and forcibly!) discover parts of your website they didn't know or care about, and probably still won't. Maybe that's something you want. I don't know.</p></li>

<li><p>In today's diverse ecosystem, it can be a real challenge to support every available platform. Solutions like <a href="http://modernizr.com/">Modernizr</a> do their best to help you adapt to all manner of devices, but <b>jankyscroll</b> elegantly resolves all issues. Performance will be just as terrible on a brand new, state-of-the-art machine as it was on your dad's old Compaq that caught fire that one time.</p></li>

<li><p>For too long, content providers have allowed ungrateful <i>users</i> to scroll wherever they please. With <b>jankyscroll</b>, you can assert your rightful dominance as a Provider of Value, and stop those thankless users from flippantly scrolling all over <i>your</i> site. Control the Scroll, with <b>jankyscroll</b>. It sucks.</p></li>
</ol>



<h2><a id="how-to" class="anchor" href="#how-to" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to use <b>jankyscroll</b></h2>

<p>If you really want to use <b>jankyscroll</b>, I guess I can't stop you. First, you would include it in your page, like this. You should already know this stuff.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script src="your/path/to/jankyscroll.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Then, initialize the plugin at the bottom of your document, if you're a good programmer who follows best practices. You're obviously not, because you're still here, reading this garbage.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script&gt; jankyscroll(trigger_distance, jank_amount); &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><i>trigger_distance</i> sets the distance, in pixels, that one has to scroll before they get jank'd. <i>jank_amount</i> sets an approximate range of just how jank'd they'll be, also in pixels.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt; jankyscroll(400, 50); &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For instance, the above code would mean that the user would be jank'd around by about 50px for every 400px scrolled.</p>
<p>Thankfully, that's all. If your <i>jank_amount</i> is greater than your <i>trigger_distance</i>, that might cause some fun problems. Who cares.</p>

<p>I snatched the starting point for this venture from The Onion's most excellent <a href="http://theonion.github.io/fartscroll.js/">fartscroll.js</a>, which I whole-heartedly <a href="http://zweig.co/jankyscroll/example.html">encourage</a> you use alongside <b>jankyscroll</b>.</p>
<p>I'd like to publically shame James Adam Buckland for encouraging this.</p>
